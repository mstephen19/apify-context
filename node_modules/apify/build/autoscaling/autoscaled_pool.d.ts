/**
 * Manages a pool of asynchronous resource-intensive tasks that are executed in parallel.
 * The pool only starts new tasks if there is enough free CPU and memory available
 * and the Javascript event loop is not blocked.
 *
 * The information about the CPU and memory usage is obtained by the {@link Snapshotter} class,
 * which makes regular snapshots of system resources that may be either local
 * or from the Apify cloud infrastructure in case the process is running on the Apify platform.
 * Meaningful data gathered from these snapshots is provided to `AutoscaledPool` by the {@link SystemStatus} class.
 *
 * Before running the pool, you need to implement the following three functions:
 * {@link AutoscaledPoolOptions#runTaskFunction},
 * {@link AutoscaledPoolOptions#isTaskReadyFunction} and
 * {@link AutoscaledPoolOptions#isFinishedFunction}.
 *
 * The auto-scaled pool is started by calling the {@link AutoscaledPool#run} function.
 * The pool periodically queries the {@link AutoscaledPoolOptions#isTaskReadyFunction} function
 * for more tasks, managing optimal concurrency, until the function resolves to `false`. The pool then queries
 * the {@link AutoscaledPoolOptions#isFinishedFunction}. If it resolves to `true`, the run finishes after all running tasks complete.
 * If it resolves to `false`, it assumes there will be more tasks available later and keeps periodically querying for tasks.
 * If any of the tasks throws then the {@link AutoscaledPool#run} function rejects the promise with an error.
 *
 * The pool evaluates whether it should start a new task every time one of the tasks finishes
 * and also in the interval set by the `options.maybeRunIntervalSecs` parameter.
 *
 * **Example usage:**
 *
 * ```javascript
 * const pool = new Apify.AutoscaledPool({
 *     maxConcurrency: 50,
 *     runTaskFunction: async () => {
 *         // Run some resource-intensive asynchronous operation here.
 *     },
 *     isTaskReadyFunction: async () => {
 *         // Tell the pool whether more tasks are ready to be processed.
 *         // Return true or false
 *     },
 *     isFinishedFunction: async () => {
 *         // Tell the pool whether it should finish
 *         // or wait for more tasks to become available.
 *         // Return true or false
 *     }
 * });
 *
 * await pool.run();
 * ```
